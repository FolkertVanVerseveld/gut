# Game Utility Toolkit
by Folkert van Verseveld and others

This library provides simple, but easy support for combining the Simple Direct media Library (SDL) with Open Graphics Language (OpenGL).
It aims to provide a similar API as the OpenGL Utility Toolkit (GLUT).
There are plans to provide simple audio support and other backends than just SDL in a future release.

## Documentation
At the moment, the library lacks easy-to-comprehend documentation in the included headers themselves.
For good pointers how to use the library we recommend to take a look at the demo folder and try to create some new demo's.

# Compilation
The following tools are required:
* SDL 2.0
* GNU Bash
* GNU Make
* gcc

Compiling should be no more than running these commands in a shell:
```
sh build.sh
make
```
