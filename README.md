# Game Utility Toolkit
by Folkert van Verseveld and others

This library provides simple, but easy support for combining the Simple Direct media Library (SDL) with Open Graphics Language (OpenGL).
It aims to provide a similar API as the OpenGL Utility Toolkit (GLUT).
There is also simple audio and TrueTypeFont support.

## Documentation
At the moment, the library lacks easy-to-comprehend documentation.
You really need to have a good gasp about OpenGL in understand how this library works.
For good pointers how to use the library we recommend to take a look at the demo folder and try to create some new demo's.
See also DEMOS for a brief description about all demo examples.

# Compilation
The following tools are required:
* SDL 2.0
* GNU Bash
* GNU Make
* gcc

Compiling should be no more than running these commands in a shell:
```
sh build.sh
make
```
